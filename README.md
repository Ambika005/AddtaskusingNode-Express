Progress Update
Error Encountered:
I faced an issue where using the disabled attribute prevented the input field's value from being included in the form's POST request. After troubleshooting, I discovered that using the readonly attribute instead resolves this issue, as it allows the field to remain non-editable while still including its value in the request.
